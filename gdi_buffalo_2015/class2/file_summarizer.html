      <br><br>Now that you've seen how fast and easy file i/o can be in Python,
      let's take a look at one of my favorite libraries that helps us do even more.
      This library is called "Pandas".
      Pandas is great at storing a lot of data with complicated internal structures.
      This library is also awesome because of how smoothly it can write data to nice formats!
      Check out this example of a file that crawls our current directory
      (wherever the file_summarizer.py file is located) and collects the name of each file,
      then writes an Excel summary of the information.
      <br>First, take a look at the whole file.
      Get used to that feeling of new code and unknown methods, you'll have it a lot!
      Personally I think that if a programmer understood everything the second they looked at it,
      they need to move along find some tougher code! Challenging yourself to read and guess is the point right now :)

      <p>
        Ok, now let's break the file down line by line.
        <br>The "os" module comes with Python itself. It contains functions to deal with the operating system.
        We'll use it to collect the files in the same directory as this script.
      </p>
      <script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/wendyjan/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class2/file_summarizer.py?slice=1:2"></script>
      <p>
        <br>The "pandas" module is not built-in, it's a third-party module.
        It's great for handling lots of data and exporting it to useful formats.
      </p>
      <script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/wendyjan/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class2/file_summarizer.py?slice=2:3"></script>
      <p>Make a list that will store the names of all the files in this folder.</p>
      <script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/wendyjan/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class2/file_summarizer.py?slice=4:6"></script>
      <p>Then use the os library's 'listdir' method to get the names of all the files in the directory '.'.
      <br>In the command line of the computer, the '.' directory means "whatever directory the script is currently inside."</p>
      <script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/wendyjan/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class2/file_summarizer.py?slice=7:9"></script>
      <p>Lastly, put our data into a Pandas data structure called a "DataFrame."
        This type is specific to Pandas, and you can read more about it at
        <a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.html">this link.</a>
        A DataFrame in Pandas is very easy to write to Excel. Just use the dedicated 'to_excel' function.

        All done! Wasn't that easy?
