      </table>
      </br>
    <h4>Other types</h4>
    
    Other numeric types include Decimal, Fraction, Binarys, Complex.
Classes are like a user-created Type, so the types in the table are referred to as “Built-in” types.

<h4>Type declaration</h4>
In some languages, when you create a variable, you need to tell the computer what type it is, for example

<p>In Java</br>
char a = “b”</p>

<p>In C++</br>
int a</br>
a = 5</p>

In Python, we don’t need to declare a type. Python decides implicitly what the type is.

<h3>Type conversion</h3>
So what are the type words listed above used for? Sometimes Python gets our intentions wrong. For example:
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/wendyjan/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/Types_overview.py?slice=79:82"></script>

We may want to change the type of an object.

Try it. At the interactive prompt, enter 
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/wendyjan/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/Types_overview.py?slice=0:2"></script>

What type do you think Python thinks x is?
To find out, try
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/wendyjan/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/Types_overview.py?slice=3:4"></script>
You can change the type of x by typing the function(x). Try
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/wendyjan/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/Types_overview.py?slice=5:8"></script>
What other types does Python allow you to change  x to? Try some.


Why would you want to change types?
because each type has different behaviors; that is each type comes with specific operators and functions. 

Try

<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/wendyjan/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/Types_overview.py?slice=9:11"></script>
<h3>Some operators and functions are type specific</h3>
<pre>
integers and floats
  standard math operators like +, *, /
  
strings
  string.upper()
  
files
  open(), read()
  
  </pre>
<h3>Many operations and functions are shared by several types</h3>
Try
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/wendyjan/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/Types_overview.py?slice=12:14"></script>
Try

<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/wendyjan/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/Types_overview.py?slice=15:17"></script>
<h4>Sequences</h4>
Several types are called sequences because they have a positional ordering:
lists, strings, tuples
So they share slicing and indexing methods like the one above. 
Compare this to dicts and sets where order doesn't matter.

<h4>Mutables</h4>
Several types are referred to as mutable.
This means that you can change them in place:
lists, dicts, sets
Think of them as objects that are meant to grow and shrink.
They share methods like append and sort.

try:

<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/wendyjan/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/Types_overview.py?slice=18:23"></script>

<h4>Immutable</h4>
Other types cannot change in place, but can be overwritten or replaced:
all numbers, bools, strings, tuples
It is a subtle difference.

<h2>PyPet</h2>
Let's make a PyPet (remember Tomagachis?)
Assign variables of different types to create characteristics of your pet, for example hungry could be
a bool that is either TRUE or FALSE.
