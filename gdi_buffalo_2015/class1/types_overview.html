    <h4>Other types</h4>
    
    Other numeric types include Decimal, Fraction, Binarys, Complex.
Classes are like a user-created Type, so the types in the table are referred to as “Built-in” types.

<h4>Type declaration</h4>
In some languages, when you create a variable, you need to tell the computer what type it is, for example

<p>In Java</br>
char a = “b”</p>

<p>In C++</br>
int a</br>
a = 5</p>

In Python, we don’t need to declare a type. Python decides implicitly what the type is.

<h3>Type conversion</h3>
So what are the type words listed above used for? Sometimes Python gets our intentions wrong. At the interactive prompt, type:
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/Izydorczak/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/Types_overview.py?slice=79:82"></script>
<p>Now try using type commands to change this so that you get an answer of 1.5.</br></p>

Let's explore types some more. 
At the interactive prompt, enter 
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/wendyjan/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/Types_overview.py?slice=0:2"></script>

What type do you think Python thinks x is?
To find out, try
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/wendyjan/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/Types_overview.py?slice=3:4"></script>
You can change the type of x. Remember that x is the integer 50. Try changing x so that it is a string. Type:
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/wendyjan/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/Types_overview.py?slice=5:8"></script>
What other types does Python allow you to change  x to? Try some. Type changes are not always allowed because some just don't make sense.


<h3>Why should we care about types?</h3>
 Some operators and functions can only be used by one type. Some operations and functions have different effects depending on type.
<h4></h4>Just a few examples:</h4></Just>
<pre>
integers and floats
  standard math operators like +, *, / do what you would expect
  
strings
  string.upper() is only for strings, while + and * concatenate (You'll try this below and find out what the word concatenate means.)
  
files
  open(), read()are only for files
  
  </pre>

Try
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/Izydorczak/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/Types_overview.py?slice=83:85"></script>
<p>The error feedback is telling us that the upper() function cannot be used on an integer.</p>
Try
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/wendyjan/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/Types_overview.py?slice=12:14"></script>

Try
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/wendyjan/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/Types_overview.py?slice=9:11"></script>

Try
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/wendyjan/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/Types_overview.py?slice=15:17"></script>
You can see from these examples that the behavior of an operation or function depends on the type of the object.

<h4>Sequences</h4>
Several types are called sequences because they have a positional ordering:
lists, strings, tuples
So they share slicing and indexing methods like the one above. 
Compare this to dicts and sets where order doesn't matter.

<h4>Mutables</h4>
Several types are referred to as mutable.
This means that you can change them in place:
lists, dicts, sets
Think of them as objects that are meant to grow and shrink.
They all have methods for adding and taking off elements. 

try:

<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/wendyjan/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/Types_overview.py?slice=18:23"></script>

<h4><b>Raise your hand when you get to here</b></h4>

<h4>Immutable</h4>
Other types cannot change in place, but can be overwritten or replaced:
all numbers, bools, strings, tuples
It is a subtle difference.

<h2>PyPet</h2>
(remember Tomagachis?)
What variables of different types could be used to create characteristics of a PyPet? Try to think of one for each type.
