  We're going to work in a file. Start a new file and save it as turtle_your_initials_here.py. Then type this in the window and run it.
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/Izydorczak/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/turtle_lesson.py?slice=1:10"></script>

<br><br>
Make sure you always save file before you run them. If you run a file and it doesn't change it's output, it may be
that you didn't save again before running. 
<br><br>
What do you think each line of the program does?
  <br><br>
Try changing the numbers in alex's movement code, or adding 1 more lines of movement. Run the program.
<br><br>
  <h4> Challenge: Can you make the turtle draw a square? Revise your code to do this. </h4>
  <h4><b>Raise your hand for a check when you get to this point.</b></h4>
<br><br>
Now try this next set of code, but first see if you can guess what it will do.
  <br><br>
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/Izydorczak/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/turtle_lesson.py?slice=11:27"></script>

Keep the first 3 lines that set up the window and turtle. Keep the last line that allows us to close the window.  Replace the other code above with this:
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/Izydorczak/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/turtle_lesson.py?slice=28:32"></script>
What do you notice? We have shortcut our routine, by using a for LOOP. Loops are used for repetition.
<br>

Here is a further shortcut. What do you thing "range(5)" does?
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/Izydorczak/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/turtle_lesson.py?slice=33:37"></script>
Now, try this version.
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/Izydorczak/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/turtle_lesson.py?slice=47:52"></script>

Guess what each of these commands does and then try them.
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/Izydorczak/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/turtle_lesson.py?slice=38:45"></script>
<br><br>
Now let's try defining our own command. We'll make a command that will instantly draw a square and we'll name it DrawSquare().
  The parentheses tell is that is is a command, or function. Type and run this.
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/Izydorczak/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/turtle_lesson.py?slice=54:62"></script>

  
But nothing happened!
We defined the function, but we didn't use it, or "call" it. This adds one more line to your file that does that:
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/Izydorczak/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/turtle_lesson.py?slice=63:65"></script>

Finally, we'll customize our function by adding parameters. Try these changes.
 <script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/Izydorczak/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/turtle_lesson.py?slice=66:77"></script>
