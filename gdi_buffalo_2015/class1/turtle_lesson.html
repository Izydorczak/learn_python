  We're going to work in a file. Start a new file and save it as turtle_your_initials_here.py. Then type this in the window and run it.
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/Izydorczak/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/turtle_lesson.py?slice=1:10"></script>


Make sure you always save file before you run them. If you run a file and it doesn't change it's output, it may be
that you didn't save again before running. 
<br>
What do you think each line of the program does?
  <br>
Try changing the numbers in alex's movement code, or adding 1 more lines of movement. Run the program.
<br>
Can you make the turtle draw a square? Revise your code to do this. Raise your hand for a check when you get to this point.
<br>
Now try this next set of code, but first see if you can guess what it will do.
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/Izydorczak/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/turtle_lesson.py?slice=1:10"></script>

Now try this code.
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/Izydorczak/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/turtle_lesson.py?slice=1:10"></script>
What do you notice? We have shortcut our routine, by using a for LOOP. Loops are used for repetition.
<br>

Here is a further shortcut. What do you thing "range(5)" does?
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/Izydorczak/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/turtle_lesson.py?slice=1:10"></script>
Now, try this version.
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/Izydorczak/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/turtle_lesson.py?slice=1:10"></script>

Guess what each of these commands does and then try them.
