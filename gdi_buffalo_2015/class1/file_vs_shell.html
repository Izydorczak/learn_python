      <br><h3>Demo of the Shell</h3>
        <br><p><i>How do I get to the shell?</i>
        <br><br>We'll use a program called IDLE. It comes with Python.
        <br>To run IDLE, open the command line and type IDLE.
        <br>For Windows, hit the Windows key, type "cmd", and hit enter.
        <br>For Mac, open the Terminal application in your Applications Folder.
        </p>
       
        <p>Here's what IDLE's Python shell looks like.
          You should see this open on your own computer.
       
        <hr>

        <br><p><i>What do I do with the shell?</i>
        <br><br>The shell interacts directly with Python.
        You type one instruction, Python executes that one instruction.
        Things go back and forth, one at a time. You, Python. You, Python.
        <br> Try typing a math expression.
        </p>
        <img src="img/shell2.png" alt="Python shell with math expression 4 + 10">
        <p>You should see Python execute the math expression and print out the result.
        <br><br>Now try out the "print" statement.
        </p>
        <img src="img/shell3.png" alt="Python shell with print 'Hello World' statement">
        <p>Python will echo back whatever you asked it to print.
        
        <br><br>What if we remove the word "print" from our instruction?
        </p>
        <img src="img/shell4.png" alt='Python shell with only "Wendy", without print statement'>
        <p>Python will echo back whatever you typed.
        But notice the difference between this response and our previous instruction with the word "print".
        
        
        <br><br>Now make your first variable.
        </p>
        <img src="img/shell5.png" alt='Python shell with "x = 'Wendy'" instruction'>
        <p>We've assigned x to hold the value of "Wendy".
        <br><br>And let's print out x.
        </p>
        <img src="img/shell6.png" alt='Python shell with "print x" instruction'>

      <br><h3>Demo of a File</h3>

        
        <br><br>In IDLE's menu, go to "File" -> "New File".
        <br>Now you should just see a blank file, without the triple carrot ">>>" that showed up on the next line of the shell.
        <br><p><i>What do I do with the file?</i>
        <br>Cut and paste this code sample in the file and save it.
        I used the name "firstFile.py".
        Make sure to get the ".py" extension.
        Save the file. At home you could save to the desktop while testing.
        <script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/wendyjan/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/firstFile.py?slice=0:4"></script>
       
        
        <br><br>Now, in the IDLE menu, click "Run" -> "Run Module".
        </p>
        
        
        
        <br>So only the lines with the word "print" actually printed out to the shell. The line with just the word "Wendy" did not print.
        This is a key difference, that was not nearly as obvious when our code was in the shell.
        We won't dwell on it for now-- it's enough to know that you need to include the word "print" each time we want output from running a file.

      <h3>Key Differences</h3>
        <p>
        So now you've run some Python code in the shell and in a file.
        The key differences:
        <ul>
          <li>The shell goes back and forth, one line at a time, like a conversation.</li>
          <li>A file allows you to type multiple instructions and then run them all at the same time.</li>
          <li>Some of the output that you see when typing at the shell is not visible when the same code is run from a file.</li>
          <li>The shell is nice for testing small things, but it won't let you save anything for reuse later.</li>
        </ul>
        
        </p>
