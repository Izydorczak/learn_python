libraries are essentially sets of functions that other people have written and that we might want to make use of.
Turtle is an example of a library. functions like these are contained it it:
<ul>
<li>forward(number_of_steps)</li>
<li>left(number_of_degrees)</li>
<li>Screen()</li>
<li>Turtle()</li>
</ul>
<h3> Options for getting and using these turtle functions</h3>
<pre>Related commands, or reserve words, include:
import
as
from
*</pre>
Look over this example. Go ahead and try it if you don't remember how it worked.

A convention in programming is to put all import statements at the top of the file. This example uses the as command to give turtle a nickname. Read it over. Trying is optional.

I can use the from command to import specific functions from the turtle library. Notice how now I don't have to use the dot notation for all.

Here I am importing all functions from turtle and again I don't need to use dot notation.

What are good reasons to use or not to use these techniques?

<h3> A Few Examples Built in Python libraries</h3>
<ul>
  <li>turtle</li>
  <li>random</li>
  <li>math</li>
  <li>os</li>
  <li>sys</li>
</ul>
Other Python libraries can be installed.
<pre>
There are many Python libraries. Developers are putting new ones out regularly that apply to a large variety of fields and purposes. Google Python libraries and find two libraries that look interesting to you.  
Use google to learn about Pythons built in calendar library. Try using the 4 methods of importing with some functions from the calendar library. Functions you might try are isleap, leapdays, weekday.
