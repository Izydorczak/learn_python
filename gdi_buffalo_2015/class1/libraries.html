libraries are essentially sets of functions that other people have written and that we might want to make use of.
Turtle is an example of a library. functions like these are contained it it:
<ul>
<li>forward(number_of_steps)</li>
<li>left(number_of_degrees)</li>
<li>Screen()</li>
<li>Turtle()</li>
</ul>
<h3> Options for getting and using these turtle functions</h3>
Reserve words include
import, as, from
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/wendyjan/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/libraries.py?slice=0:5"></script>

Convention is to put all import statements at the top of the file. This example uses as to give turtle a nickname.

I can use from to import specific functions from the turtle library. Now I don't have to use the dot notation for all.

Here I am importing all functions from turtle and I don't need to use dot notation.

What are good reasons to use or not to use these techniques?

<h3>Built in Python libraries</h3>
<ul>
  <li>turtle</li>
  <li>random</li>
  <li>math</li>
  <li>os</li>
  <li>sys</li>
</ul>
<h3>Other Python libraries can be installed</h3>

Use pip to install, which we won't go into here. Look up some.
