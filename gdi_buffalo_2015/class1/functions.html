<h4>Terminology</h4>
<ul>
<li>Defining a function means that you are making your own tool. You make up a name for the function. The name is like a variable, but it has parentheses after it, with or without parameters.
</li>
<li>Parameters are the variables that you specify for your function, for example the length of a side of a square. Some functions won't have any parameters.</li> 
<li>Return tells what the function gives back to you. Some functions won't return anything.</li>
<li>Calling a function happens when you use it somewhere in your program.</li>
</ul>
<h3>statements and expressions you’ll use</h3>
<table border = "1" style = "width:100%">

Try
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/wendyjan/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/functions.py?slice=0:2"></script>

In my program, anytime I want to give credit to Mark Lutz, I would type:
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/wendyjan/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/functions.py?slice=3:4"></script>

Here is a definition for a function that computes tips. It takes the parameters of percentage and total and returns the amount to tip. By itself, it does nothing. Put it in a file.
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/wendyjan/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/functions.py?slice=5:7"></script>

Now call the function.
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/wendyjan/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/functions.py?slice=8:9"></script>

We still don't see anything. So print the returned tip like this:
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/wendyjan/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/functions.py?slice=10:11"></script>

Here is  a program that uses our tip function to compute a tip when the user inputs bill and percentage. Try it.
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/wendyjan/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/functions.py?slice=12:15"></script>

The whole point of functions are that they are multi-purpose. Here I use the function in a different program that simulates a wait staff tip for an average evening with 8 customers.
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/wendyjan/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/functions.py?slice=16:23"></script>

Add print statements to convince yourself that the program is working.
<pre>Write a program that suggests tips at the end of a restaurant bill. 
The restaurant worker should be prompted for the prices of food items. 
So put the raw_input function, asking for the price of an item, in a loop.
This way the restaurant worker is repeatedly prompted.
You can assume a number of items and make a for loop. 
Your program should then total the bill and suggest tips at rates of 15%, 17% and 20%.
</pre>
<h3>Function Notes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Functions involve stand alone definitions AND calls to the function within a program. The definition must come before the call.</li>
<li>A function is defined using def, the name you choose, and () with or without parameters for input.</li>
<li>The function may or may not end with a return statement.</li>
<li>Variables that you define as parameters for your function don’t have to have the same name as the parameters that you send to the function. Variables in our examples are matched by position.</li>
</ul>

I define a function
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/wendyjan/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/functions.py?slice=24:29"></script>

I use the function in my program.
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/wendyjan/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/functions.py?slice=30:34"></script>

<h3>A function for our Pypet</h3>

Here is a PyPet happy expressions function. What does it do?
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/wendyjan/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/functions.py?slice=35:38"></script>

Now we use it in a program.
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/wendyjan/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/functions.py?slice=39:45"></script>

Example with parameter but no return
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/wendyjan/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/functions.py?slice=46:50"></script>
import random

What other functions might we have for our pets?
