<h3>Some analogies</h3>

<p>outsourcing a job (sometimes with parameters, sometimes a returned item sometimes not)
example: advertising, paychecks, photocopying</p>

<p>using a tool (emphasize repeated need and reusability, making the tool)
example: scissors in my purse, tool for getting star on tree - if it works for other tall things even better</p>

<h4>Terminology</h4>
Defining a function means that you are making your tool. You make up a name for the function. The name is like a variable, but it has parentheses after it, with or without parameters.
Calling a function means you are ready to use it.
Parameters are the variables that you specify for your function, for example things you give to your scissors, or advertiser. 
Return is what they give back to you.
There doesn't necessarily have to be either or both. (example flashlight, 

<h3>statements and expressions you’ll use</h3>

Example
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/wendyjan/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/functions.py?slice=0:2"></script>

In main program, anytime I want to give credit to Mark Lutz, I would type:
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/wendyjan/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/functions.py?slice=3:4"></script>

Another example, first have them computer a tip and show round
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/wendyjan/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/functions.py?slice=5:7"></script>

Try <script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/wendyjan/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/functions.py?slice=8:9"></script>

Try
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/wendyjan/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/functions.py?slice=10:11"></script>

Here is  a program that computes a tip when the user inputs bill and percentage
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/wendyjan/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/functions.py?slice=12:15"></script>

I use the function in a different program that simulates a wait staff tip for an average evening with 8 customers
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/wendyjan/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/functions.py?slice=16:23"></script>

Add print statements to convince yourself that the program is working.
Excersize: Write a program that suggests tips at the end of a restaurant bill. 
The restaurant worker should be prompted for the prices of food items (Use raw_input) in a loop. 
You can assume a number of items and make a for loop, or you can try a while loop.
Your program should total the bill and suggest tips at rates of 15%, 17% or 20%.

<h3>Function Notes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Functions involve stand alone definitions AND calls to a function within a program or several programs. (mention turtle functions)</li>
<li>A function is defined using def, the name you choose, and () with or without parameters for input.</li>
<li>The function may or may not end with a return statement.</li>
<li>The functions would precede the main program if you have them in one file.</li>
<li>Variables that you define as parameters for your function don’t have to have the same name as the parameters that you send to the function. Variables in our examples are matched by position.</li>
</ul>

I define a function
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/wendyjan/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/functions.py?slice=24:29"></script>

I use the function in my program
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/wendyjan/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/functions.py?slice=30:34"></script>

<h3>A function for our Pypet</h3>

PyPet happy expressions function - random happy expressions
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/wendyjan/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/functions.py?slice=35:38"></script>

In a program
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/wendyjan/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/functions.py?slice=39:45"></script>

Example with parameter but no return
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/wendyjan/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/functions.py?slice=46:50"></script>
import random

What other functions might we have for our pets?
Exercise:
Create a dictionary that pairs at least 3 English words with 3 words of another language. Write a function called converter(French_word) that takes the other language word and returns the English word.
