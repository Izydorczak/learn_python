Suppose we want to control our Pypet. Start a file named yourname_temp. Type this in your temp file and then run it several times.

<h3>if/else structure</h3>
<ul>
<li>a colon goes after the if statement, elif statement, and else statements</li>
<li>blocks with actions that follow these must be indented consistently</li>
<li>if and elif (else if) contain a test statement that is either True or False</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h4> Challenge: Improve upon your Pypet program.</h4>

Make use of +=.<br>
Add hungry = hungry.upper() so that if the user enters lowercase 'y' or 'n' it still works. <br>
Add a statement to show the amount of food at the end. <br>
Add code before the else statement that uses elif hungry == "N" and follow it with a print statement.<br>
<h4><b>Raise your hand for a check when you get to this point.</b></h4>
      
<h3>Tests using Comparison Operators</h3>

<ul>
<li>Greater than, Less than, Greater than or equal to >, <, >= </li>
<li>Equal ==</li>
<li>Not equal !=</li>
</ul>
Try these in the console, or shell:
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/izydorczak/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/if_else.py?slice=68:73"></script>
<h3>Logical Operators</h3>

<ul>
<li>or</li>
<li>and</li>
<li>not</li>
<li>in</li>
</ul>
Try these in the console, or shell. Remember to guess the outputs first.
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/izydorczak/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/if_else.py?slice=74:84"></script>
Every object actually has a boolean value and can be used as a test. This means that every number, string, etc. has a value of True or False. Most of them are considered True.
      Think of an object as True if it is not empty or zero.
Try
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/izydorczak/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/if_else.py?slice=85:92"></script>
Try this in your temp file. You can delete prior work in the temp file as we try things there.
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/izydorczak/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/if_else.py?slice=8:14"></script>

<br>

Next try this in your temp file. Run it several times.
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/izydorczak/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/if_else.py?slice=14:24"></script>
<!--
<br>You can actually replace a whole if block with one line. This is called an inline statement. See how the line below can replace a large
      portion of the block above here? These are convenient, though harder to read. Use them only when they are short and readable.
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/izydorczak/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/if_else.py?slice=24:26"></script>

<h3>Branching</h3>
This use of multiple elifs is called branching. Try this in your temp file.
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/izydorczak/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/if_else.py?slice=31:43"></script>
