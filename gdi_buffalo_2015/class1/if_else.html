<h3>Logic if/else</h3>

Suppose we want to control our Pypet.
hungry = raw_input(“Are you hungry? Type Y or N ”)
food = 0

if hungry == “Y”:
	print “Here is a treat for you.”
	food = food + 1
else:
	print “okay”


How could you improve this? +=, elif, hungry = hungry.upper(), print food

<h3>if/else structure</h3>

a colon goes after the if statement, elif statement, and else statements
blocks with actions that follow these must be indented consistently
if and elif contain a statement that is either True or False

if test1:
	statements1
elif test2:
	statements2
else:
	statements3


Try
pigs = “fly”
if pigs = “fly”:
print “This prints.”
else:
print “This does not print.”	

Try changing the test, print statements and bool expression. Try adding elif. (show could just put True for test)



Try

import random

x = random.randint(-10,10)

if x < 0:
	sign = “negative”
elif x ==0:
	sign = “none”
else:
	sign = “positive”
print sign, x


Inline if statements
sign = “positive” if x > 0 else “negative”



<h3>Branching</h3>

grade = raw_input(“Enter a whole number grade between 0 and 100 “)

if grade > 90:
	print “A”
elif grade < 90 and grade > 80:
	print “B”

(code problem is string)

A better way:



<h3>Guess at the output of these and then try them.</h3>

Try
x = 1
y = 2
if x == 1 and y > 1:
	if y == 1:
		print “tomato”
	print “potato”
print “cabbage”


Try
x = ‘sand’
if ‘sand’ in ‘sandwiches’:
	print x*3
	x += ‘wich’
	if x.endswith(‘wich’):
		x *=2
		print x


Try
x = [1,3,5,7,11]
if x[0:2] != [1,3]:
	print ‘nope’
	if x[4] == 11:
		print ‘yup’
else:
	print ‘yup yup’
