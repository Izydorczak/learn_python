<h3>Loops allow us to repeat a procedure </h3>

<h3>Some looping (and related) reserved words in Python:</h3>

<ul>
<li>for</li>
<li>in</li>
<li>while</li>
<li>break</li>
<li>continue</li>
<li>else</li>
<li>range</li>
<li>enumerate</li>
</ul>

<h3>for is useful for doing something to or with each item in a list or other iterable.</h3>

Try 
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/wendyjan/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/Loops.py?slice=1:2"></script>
dogs = [‘Rover’, ‘Max’, ‘Holly’]
for dog in dogs:
	dog = dog + ‘\’s’
	print dog
Try 
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/wendyjan/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/Loops.py?slice=1:2"></script>
for letter in “word”:
	print letter + “uba”

Try 
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/wendyjan/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/Loops.py?slice=1:2"></script>
ages_later = []
years = 10
ages = [12, 15, 17]
for age in ages:
	age +=years
	ages_later.append(age)
print ages_later


<h3>range is useful for number sequences</h3>

Try
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/wendyjan/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/Loops.py?slice=1:2"></script>
range(5)

Try
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/wendyjan/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/Loops.py?slice=1:2"></script>
for x in range(5):
	print x**2

Try
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/wendyjan/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/Loops.py?slice=1:2"></script>
ages_later = []
years = 10
for age in range(12,18):
	age +=years
	ages_later.append(age)
print ages_later


back to dogs, repeat code and this time add
print dogs
notice that the original list has not changed. We only temporarily changed each dog.

Most of the time we iterate through a list by items, like dogs. Sometimes it is useful to iterate by the index of each item. Each item in a list has a corresponding index number, starting with 0.

Here is code that would change each dog in the list.
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/wendyjan/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/Loops.py?slice=1:2"></script>
dogs = [‘Rover’, ‘Holly’]
for i in range(len(dogs)):
	dogs[i] = dogs[i] + ‘\’s’
print dogs

This code uses range and len to shuffle a group of items.
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/wendyjan/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/Loops.py?slice=1:2"></script>

cards = [‘ace’, 2,3,4,’queen’]
for i in range(len(cards)):
	cards = cards[i:] + cards[:i]
	print cards

Most of the time, it is better and more “Pythonic” to use for without indexing.
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/wendyjan/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/Loops.py?slice=1:2"></script>
multiples_of_two_and_three = []
for x in range(100):
	if x%2 == 0 and x%3==0:
		multiples_of_two_and_three.append(x)

print multiples_of_two_and_three

Another useful function within for loops is enumerate(list).

Try
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/wendyjan/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/Loops.py?slice=1:2"></script>
for i, day in enumerate([Mon, Tue, Wed, Thurs, Fri]):
	print i, day


<h2><While loops</h2>


Different from for because it will continue to loop until some condition is met, indefinite number of repetitions

<h3>Pypet with while loops</h3>
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/wendyjan/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/Loops.py?slice=1:2"></script>
food = 0
while food < 5:

hungry = raw_input(“Are you hungry? Type Y or N ”)
if hungry == “Y”:
		print “Here is a treat for you.”
		food += 1

print “I feel full”

Then add break for else within loop.
Then add else for while loop with print i feel full.
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/wendyjan/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/Loops.py?slice=1:2"></script>
food = 0

while food < 5:

	hungry = raw_input('Are you hungry? Type Y or N ')

	if hungry == 'Y':
		print 'Here is a treat for you.'
		food += 1
	else:
		break

else:
	print "I sure was hungry!"
print 'Now what?'

<h3>Control Flow with while</h3>
<ul>
<li>break will break out of the loop and go to the next statement outside of the loop without executing anything else within the loop.</li>
<li><continue will return to the top of the loop./li>
<li>else will execute if the loop condition fails. Gets skipped if there is a break.</li>
</ul>
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/wendyjan/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/Loops.py?slice=1:2"></script>
dogs = [‘Holly’, ‘Max’, ‘Sadie’, ‘Joey’]
while dogs:					#unempty lists have the boolean value of True
	print dogs.pop(0) + “ barks.”		# pop gets an item AND removes it from the list
	print dogs

Change so that if the dog is Sadie, it doesn’t bark, but does keep going with the loop.
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/wendyjan/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/Loops.py?slice=1:2"></script>
dogs = ['Holly','Max','Sadie','Joey']
i = 0
while len(dogs) > 1:
	if dogs[i] == 'Sadie':
		i=1
		continue
	print dogs.pop(i) + " barks"
	print dogs


What does this program do?
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/wendyjan/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/Loops.py?slice=1:2"></script>
x = 10
while x:			#remember x has the boolean value of True
	x = x-1
	if x % 2 != 0:
		continue
	print x

<h3>Warning: Watch out for infinite loops</h3>

DO NOT TYPE THIS
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/wendyjan/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/Loops.py?slice=1:2"></script>
x = 11
while x > 10:
	print “uh oh”

DO NOT TYPE THIS
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/wendyjan/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/Loops.py?slice=1:2"></script>
while True:
	print “uh oh”

To prevent infinite loops, there should be a condition in the while statement that will eventually be met OR there should be a break, usually in conjunction with if/then

<h3>Nested Loops</h3>

Try 
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/wendyjan/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/Loops.py?slice=1:2"></script>
dogs = [‘Rover’, ‘Max’, ‘Holly’]
toys = [‘bone’, ‘squirrel’]
for dog in dogs:
	for toy in toys:
		print ‘That is ‘ + dog + ‘\’s ’ + toy + ‘.’
	
Other options for formatting the string
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/wendyjan/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/Loops.py?slice=1:2"></script>
	print “That is %s\’s %s.” % (dog,toy)

Try this program to search the first list for items in the second list
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/wendyjan/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/Loops.py?slice=1:2"></script>
items = [“aaa”, 111, (4,5), 2.01]
tests = [(4,5), 3.14]
for thing in tests:
	for item in items:
		if item == thing:
			print thing + “was found”

		else:
			print thing + “was not found”
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/wendyjan/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/Loops.py?slice=1:2"></script>
