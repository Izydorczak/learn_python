<h3>Loops allow us to repeat a procedure. </h3>

<h4>Some looping (and related) reserved words in Python:</h4>

<ul>
<li>for</li>
<li>in</li>
<li>while</li>
<li>break</li>
<li>continue</li>
<!--<li>while else</li>-->
<li>range</li>
<!--<li>enumerate</li>-->
</ul>

<h4>for is useful for doing something to or with each item in a list or other iterable.</h4>

Try in a temporary file. 
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/izydorczak/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/Loops.py?slice=0:5"></script>
Notice that the original list called 'dogs' doesn't change.</br>
<!--Most of the time we use a for loop to go through a list using each item in the list one at a time.
There are a few cases when we would rather go through the list using the index of each item instead of the item itself.
Recall that the index is the number of the item in the list. The index of the leftmost item is 0.
Here is an example of when we might want to iterate through by index.Try:
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/izydorczak/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/Loops.py?slice=27:32"></script>

Here is an example of iterating over a string instead of a list. Try: 
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/izydorczak/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/Loops.py?slice=5:7"></script>

Here is an example of a common routine where we start with an empty list and fill it as we loop through another list. Remember to guess the outcome before trying:
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/izydorczak/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/Loops.py?slice=8:15"></script>

This code uses indexing to shuffle a group of items. Think about what is happening here. You may need to write it out to make sense of it.
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/izydorczak/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/Loops.py?slice=33:37"></script>

Try to figure out what this will do, then try it.
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/izydorczak/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/Loops.py?slice=38:43"></script>

<!--Another useful function within for loops is enumerate(list).

Try
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/izydorczak/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/Loops.py?slice=44:46"></script>

<h2>While loops</h2>

A while loop is different from a for loop because it will continue to loop until some condition is met. There can be an indefinite number of repetitions.

<h4>Pypet with while loops</h4>
Put this in your Pypet file and run it.
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/izydorczak/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/Loops.py?slice=47:54"></script>



<h4>Control Flow with while</h4>
<ul>
<li>break will break out of the loop and go to the next statement outside of the loop without executing anything else within the loop.</li>
<li>continue will return to the top of the loop without completing the rest of the code in that block this time through.</li>
<!--<li>else will execute if the loop condition fails and is skipped if there is a break.</li>-->
</ul>

Let's change this so that if the dog is Sadie, it doesnâ€™t bark, but does keep going with the loop. Try to trace through this code to understand it before running it.

What does this program do?

Add the lines below to improve your Pypet. Notice how break is used and how while/else is used.

<h3>Warning: Watch out for infinite loops</h3>

To prevent infinite loops, there should be a condition in the while statement that will eventually be met OR there should be a break, usually in conjunction with if/then

<h3>Nested Loops</h3>
