      <h3>Some Examples</h3>
      <p><i>Click the blue "This Gist" link at the bottom left of each example to see the source code on my Github account.</i>

      <br><br>Here's a small dictionary.
      </p>
      <script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/wendyjan/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/dictionaries.py?slice=8:9"></script>
      <p>Notice the syntax: there are colons between each pair of items.
      In a dictionary, everything is stored in a pair.
      <br>But a dictionary is more than just pairs of items-- the first member of the pair is a "key", and the second is a "value".
      <br>In this example, "Wendy" is a unique key, and its value is "Jansson".
      We can look up any value in the dictionary using its key. We can also add a new key-value pair.
      <br>Just like we used a bracket to select a single ordered element from a list, we use a bracket to select a single value for a key, or store a new value for a key.
      <br>Try out the code below:
      </p>
      <script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/wendyjan/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/dictionaries.py?slice=11:14"></script>
      <p>Do you have a guess what might happen if we try to put in two "Joe" keys with different values?
      </p>
      <script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/wendyjan/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/dictionaries.py?slice=11:18"></script>
      <p>
         The first value will just be replaced by the second value.
         This means that the keys must be unique! We can't have two "Joe" keys in the same dictionary with different values.
      <br>And what if we ask for the value of a key we haven't put in yet?
      </p>
      <script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/wendyjan/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/dictionaries.py?slice=19:20"></script>
      <p>An error is thrown.
      <br><br>
      Now let's return to our PyPet example, and store all of that information in a single dictionary.
      </p>
      <script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/wendyjan/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/dictionaries.py?slice=21:23"></script>
      <p>We can describe our entire PyPet using a dictionary.
      <br>We can also print out the dictionary that describes Monty very easily:
      </p>
      <script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/wendyjan/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/dictionaries.py?slice=21:25"></script>
      <p>
      In the line that begins the for loop,
      we got a list of all the dictionary's keys by calling "monty.keys()".
      <br>We also set up the letter 'k' as a temporary variable.
      It exists only inside the for loop,
      and lets us iterate through all the keys in the dictionary for our PyPet.
      <br>Notice that we can't control the order of iteration for a dictionary,
      like we could for a list.
      <br>Dictionaries are a hashmap, which store key-value pairs.
      There is no inherent order, just the unique keys to store their values.
