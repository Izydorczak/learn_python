#Fix this paragraph so that the line print(paragraph) at the end will print the paragraph
#with all the groots capitalized and the first letter of each sentence capitalized. 

# print(paragraph) should give us the original paragraph, with all the groots capitalized
paragraph = "i am groot. yeah we know who you are. i am groot. yeah you just said that. i wasn't retrieving the orb for ronan, i was betraying him. i am groot. well that's just as fascinating as the first eighty-nine times you told me that."
